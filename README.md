## üõ† **Requirements**

Before running ArcadeScore, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

### **üîπ Option 1: Running with Docker**
- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- **Docker Compose** (included with newer versions of Docker)

### **üîπ Option 2: Running with Python**
- **Python 3.8+** (Ensure it's installed and added to your system PATH)
- **pip** (Included with Python, but can be updated: `python -m ensurepip --default-pip`)
- **7-Zip** (Required for exports)
  - **Windows**: Automatically installed via `setup.bat` if missing
  - **Linux/macOS**: Installed via `setup.sh` (uses `apt` or `yum`)

#### **üí° Additional Notes**
- **Linux/macOS users** may need `sudo` for dependency installations.
- **Ensure port 8080 is available** if running directly via Python.

## üì• **Installation Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mikedmor/ArcadeScore.git
    cd ArcadeScore
    ```

2. **Create and update .env file**
    Create a .env file following the .env.sample for assistance. Your file should look something like this. If running via docker, ensure your server ip is static on the network, and then include that ip in the SERVER_HOST_IP. 

    ```env
    # BOTH DOCKER OR STANDALONE
    ARCADESCORE_HTTP_PORT=8080

    # WEBHOOK SETUP
    SERVER_HOST_IP=192.168.x.x # Ensure this is static

    # REQUIRED FOR DOCKER
    ## NGINX SERVER
    SERVER_NAME="localhost"
    SSL_PEM=selfsigned.info.pem
    SSL_KEY=selfsigned.info.key

    ## DOCKER MOUNTS
    DOCKER_HTTP_PORT=80
    DOCKER_HTTPS_PORT=443
    ```

3. **Run the software**:

    a. **Set Up Docker** (Recommended):
    Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine. Build and run the container:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

    To stop the software
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

    b. **Run via Python**:
    If you prefer running ArcadeScore outside of Docker, follow the setup for your system:

    üñ• Windows:
    Run the following in Command Prompt (cmd):
    ```bash
    setup.bat
    ```

    üêß Linux/macOS:
    Run the following in Terminal:
    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```

4. **Install Certificates** (Optional):
    If you want to remove the browser warnings when utilizing https urls then you will want to install the certificates so that your computer reconizes them as a "Trusted Root Certification Authority". Follow these steps to do that.

    - In the certs folder find the `selfsigned.crt`
    - right click on this file and select "Install Certificate" (Windows)
    - select "Local Machine" then click Next, allow UAC
    - select "Place all certificates in the following store", then press the browse button
    - Select "Trusted Root Certification Authorities", then press Ok
    - Press Next, then Finish to install the certificate
    - Done, you should now be able to access https://localhost and see the application without a warning

    Note: These steps utilize the included self-signed certificates. If you want more security then it is recommended that you generate your own using OpenSSL
    ```bash
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout selfsigned.key -out selfsigned.crt -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost" && \
      openssl x509 -outform der -in selfsigned.crt -out selfsigned.der && \
      cat selfsigned.key selfsigned.crt > selfsigned.pem
    ```

    Alternatively if you remove these certificats, the system will autogenerate new ones for you (Docker Only), but you will want to pull these from the container and install them on all machines that will access the application 
    
    Note: VPin Studio Server API only communicates via HTTP, however the system has a built in proxy pass to handle this when needed

5. **Access the Application**:
  - Open your browser and navigate to **`http://localhost`**. You should see the landing page.
  - Click the scoreboard to access the **default scoreboard**, or create a new one

6. **Default Setup**:
    The default settings create a sample scoreboard. Customize settings via the admin menu on the scoreboard!
