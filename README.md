## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ArcadeScore.git
    cd ArcadeScore
    ```

2. **Create and update .env file**
   Create a .env file following the .env.sample for assistance

3. **Set Up Docker**:
    Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine. Build and run the container:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

4. **Set Up Host**:
    In order to connect this with VPin Studio, you must mimic iScored.info. The simplest way to do this is by updating your Windows HOSTS file to load your server running ArcadeScore:

    - First open notepad, be sure to "Run as Administrator"
    - Next open your HOSTS file, generally found in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
    - At the end of the file add the following, be sure to replace the ip with the one running your server
    ```bash
    192.168.x.x iscored.info
    192.168.x.x www.iscored.info
    ```

5. **Install Certificates**:
    Another requirement to get this working is to have a valid SSL certificate. This is difficult however since we do not own the domain name iscored.info. Instead what we can do is install the self-signed certificate, but you will need to do this in a few places.

    a. Any device that will access the dashboard webpage
    - in the certs folder find the `iscored.info.crt`
    - right click on this file and select "Install Certificate" (Windows)
    - select "Local Machine" then click Next, allow UAC
    - select "Place all certificates in the following store", then press the browse button
    - Select "Trusted Root Certification Authorities", then press Ok
    - Press Next, then Finish to install the certificate
    - Done, you should now be able to access iscored.info and see the application
    
    b. Any machine running VPin Studio (i.e., VPin Studio Server & Client)
    - Note: You will need to do this on every machine running VPin Studio.
    - You will need the `keytool` Java utility. Install [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk23-windows).
    - Ensure that your system `PATH` includes the JDK `/bin` folder. You may need to restart your pc after doing this.
    - Locate the `iscored.info.der` file (for Java).
    - Locate the `cacerts` file for VPin Studio:
      - **VPin Studio Client**: `C:\vPinball\VPin-Studio-Client\win32\java\lib\security\cacerts`
      - **VPin Studio Server**: `C:\vPinball\VPin-Studio\win32\java\lib\security\cacerts`
    - Open a **terminal (as Administrator)** in the folder containing `iscored.info.der` and run:
    ```bash
    keytool -import -trustcacerts -file iscored.info.der -alias iscored_info -keystore <path-to-cacerts>
    ```
    - The password for VPin-Studio cacerts is `changeit`

    These steps utilize the included self-signed certificates. If you want more security then it is recommended that you generate your own using OpenSSL.
    ```bash
    openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout cert.key -out cert.crt -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=iscored.info" && \
      openssl x509 -outform der -in cert.crt -out cert.der && \
      cat cert.key cert.crt > cert.pem
    ```

    Make sure you replace the .crt, .der, .key, and .pem files in the cert folder before running `docker-compose up --build -d` otherwise this will not work!

6. **Access the Application**:
    - Open your browser and navigate to **`https://iscored.info`**. You should see the landing page.
   - Click the button to access the **default dashboard**.
   - Open **VPin Studio** and go to the **Competitions page**.
   - Switch to the **iScored Subscriptions** tab.
   - Click **Add Subscription** and enter the following URL:
     ```
     https://www.iscored.info/default
     ```
   - Click **Refresh** to load available tables. 
   - If a table does not appear, ensure that the corresponding game is installed in VPin Studio.

7. **Default Setup**:
    The default settings create a sample dashboard. Customize settings via the admin menu on the dashboard!
